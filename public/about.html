<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello I'm Ricardo. I'm from México on the state of Queretaro. I'm a very fan of F1 videogames and the all the related world of tecnology. Thats the reason i like to become a Full Stack Web Developer and Game Developer but i'm in process to learn about to become one and work in the industry first becoming a freelancer to get this experience that i need then start working on a high company like Microsoft or another one who like to contract me.</p>

<p>Actually i'm studying Game Development on the university and Web Development online with courses and with the topics that are in the study plan of the university.</p>

<p>I speak Spanish very well because it is my mother tongue, but my English is not bad at all. I can write very well, but speaking and sometimes understanding some words is my weakness.</p>

<p>That´s all about me. I hope one day look again this initial portafolio when i have become a senior Developer and see my beginning. </p>
